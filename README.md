## STM Tuning static single-page website.

The goal of this project is to create an effective, single-page static website that can be used to greater enhance the visibility of STM Tuning in Spokane, WA while reducing the team's need to interact with the page directly.

I intend to build this website using React and deploying via AWS S3 hosting.
