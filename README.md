## STM Tuning static single-page website.

The goal of this project is to create an effective, single-page static website that can be used to greater enhance the visibility of STM Tuning in Spokane, WA while reducing the team's need to interact with the page directly.

I intend to build this website using React and deploying via AWS S3 hosting.

### Updates

1. 03/05/25
    - Reconsidered project setup and re-launched from `npm create vite@latest` while transferring relevant files.
    - Using TS + React + Bootstrap
    - Tested setup with google fonts and bootstrap CDN link (since CDN is usually already downloaded)
